### Facebook Mobility by Local Government Area

These datas, sourced through the Facebook Data For Good program, provide various aggregated metrics
relating to mobility, including a measure of the 'stay-at-home ratio' during the COVID-19 crisis.
The areas in question are given by standard ABS LGA codes; the associated geometries may be freely sourced [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.003~July%202016~Main%20Features~Local%20Government%20Areas%20(LGA)~7).
