### Facebook Mobility by Local Government Area

These datas, sourced through the Facebook Data For Good program, provide an estimate of the 'Stay At Home Percentage' per day per council area for several Australian regions, as well as the percentage anomaly daily from the full-timeseries average. The areas in question are given by standard ABS LGA codes; the associated geometries may be freely sourced [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.003~July%202016~Main%20Features~Local%20Government%20Areas%20(LGA)~7).
