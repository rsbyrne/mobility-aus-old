# Crisis Mobility Data Portal

This repository has been established to provide free and easy access to aggregated mobility data products from Facebook and other sources. The data held here is authorised for general release to the public to support research activities related to the COVID-19 epidemic.

The site was established on the 12 May 2020 and will be updated at midnight daily for the foreseeable future.

*STATUS - 21 May 2020*

Facebook's restrictive new download limits continue to be a problem. The Victorian and Melbourne datasets are now available, but the larger New South Wales datasets will not be available until tomorrow. Note that, once the bulk of the data is downloaded, only minimal daily updates will be required, at which point Facebook's policies will no longer be an issue.

### Facebook Mobility by Local Government Area

These datas, sourced through the Facebook Data For Good program, provide an estimate of the 'Stay At Home Percentage' per day per council area for several Australian regions, as well as the percentage anomaly daily from the full-timeseries average. The areas in question are given by standard ABS LGA codes; the associated geometries may be freely sourced [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.003~July%202016~Main%20Features~Local%20Government%20Areas%20(LGA)~7).
